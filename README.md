# Hi there, I'm Madhu Sachan 👋

## Full Stack Developer | .NET Expert | Cloud Solutions Architect

I'm a Full Stack Developer with over **9 years of hands-on experience** delivering high-quality web and cloud-based applications for businesses of all sizes. I have strong expertise in both frontend and backend development, with the last 5 years focused primarily on **backend engineering**, building reliable, scalable, and secure systems.

### 🚀 About Me

My core strength lies in the **.NET ecosystem**, particularly **C#** and **ASP.NET Core**, where I design and implement APIs, microservices, and enterprise-grade applications. I have extensive experience working with **Microsoft Azure**, leveraging its cloud infrastructure for hosting, automation, and deployment. My background also includes setting up and managing **Azure DevOps** pipelines, integrating CI/CD processes, and ensuring smooth end-to-end software delivery.

On the frontend side, I'm comfortable working with **React**, **Angular**, and **TypeScript**, creating intuitive user interfaces that complement powerful backend systems. This combination allows me to manage full product lifecycles—from concept and architecture to deployment and maintenance.

Over the years, I've collaborated with clients across various industries, helping them modernize legacy systems, migrate to the cloud, and optimize performance. I focus on writing clean, maintainable code, following best practices, and maintaining clear communication throughout every project. My goal is to build software that's not only functional but also **future-ready**.
